A landing page made using HTML and CSS.

Created while progressing through The Odin Project's curriculum.

I absolutely plan on coming back to this in the near future as the basis for my own full-fledged website, and making some of the following adjustments as I reflect on what I can improve on.

- Take a more professional picture of myself.
- The "logo-text" in the left side of the header can be improved on, with more styling or using an actual image.
- Adjust color scheme a bit maybe.
- The 4 containers in the "Some Things About Me" (should probably rename this too) wrap when the width of the page gets small, but with 3 on one row, and 1 on the next initially. Ideally there is a way to make it instantly go from 4 in a row to 2 on each row.
- Populating the "About", "My Projects", and "Resume" sections.
- Adjusting the banner prompt to check out projects, including replacing the banner content with something else instead.
- Replacing the contents of the "Some Things About Me" section with more than just languages (for the 3 rightmost boxes), including future projects or interests.
- Making the page mobile-friendly, as well as making the contents shrink and grow more "naturally".
- For future projects I will spend more time planning out the classes I use, and well as divs, since I believe I could have made my code more space efficient and organized, for a more clean and understandable structure overall.
